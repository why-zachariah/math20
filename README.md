# math20
this repository is for my math20 (probability) class, where I coded a project to determine the randomness in chatgpt response times (and am pursuing it further after the class). I had limited access to the ChatGPT API, so I utilized a local GPT-Neo 1.3B model, a proxy for ChatGPT, by sending similar prompts repeatedly.

in my final report, I included this for future work: 
"Future work could involve accessing the official ChatGPT API to conduct a more direct analysis with larger datasets. This would allow for comprehensive comparisons between different model versions, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, refining our understanding of randomness. Additionally, exploring other aspects of randomness, like entropy in token selection or prompt variability, could offer deeper insights. Bayesian methods and alternative distributions, such as log-normal or Weibull, might also yield a better fit and a more accurate representation of ChatGPTâ€™s stochastic processes."
